We are now porting **organize** which deals with the whole
big tree of items down to just a few targeted individual
stories.

For now we are dealing with one specific story

https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8432709

and all of its descendants...
Including mainly the underlying comments.

That is why fetchtop starts at the id shown above
and goes through **8442000**.
